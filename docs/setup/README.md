## Which way?

We have three ways of installing Alice for now, well, four, if you count Docker. As of november 2021 the prefered install method is AliceCli setup, as fabricating an image to burn on your SD everytime we push a new version is time-consuming and error prone and manually installing requires a lot of steps from users. We will resume image creation when version 1 is released.

- [AliceCli](alice-cli)
- [Manual setup](manual-install)
- [Prefabricated Raspberry Pi OS image](image-install)
- [Docker](docker)
